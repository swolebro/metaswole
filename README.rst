These are the project files that are used to create `my rtfd.org webspace`_.
Since RTFD partitions projects by subdomain, using one top-level metaproject
for my account and adding each actual project underneath it as a sub is
cleaner (namespaces are good!) and easier from a CNAME/redirect/internet
wizardry point of view too.

If you've got general questions for me, you can open a ticket on this project.
I'm pretty sure I don't have an email published anywhere for direct messages
at this point, and that's the way I like it.
